# Discord Bridge
This is a [Sponge](http://spongepowered.com) plugin to integrate [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) server with a [Discord](https://discordapp.com) channel. 

## Features

- Player's chat messages in Minecraft are sent to specified Discord channels, and chat messages in specific Discord channels are also sent to online players in Minecraft.
- Admins and mods can log in to their own Discord account, so that chat messages show under their names in Discord.
- Emoji is converted between Minecraft and Discord format. Details are showed in [EMOJI.md](EMOJI.md).
- Clickable URL.
- Multiple channels with custom configuration for each channel. E.g.:
  - 1 public channel to send & receive messages between Discord and Minecraft
  - 1 monitoring channel to record only server start/stop and player join/leave events
  - 1 staff-only channel that send message one-way from Discord to Minecraft with a special announcement template
- Set game activity of the bot
- Ignore Discord messages from all bots and/or blacklist certain prefixes
- Support One-Time Password
- **New in 2.3.0**
  - Mentions in Discord show properly in Minecraft with configurable templates
  - Mentions from Minecraft are supported with permission control (check **Additional Permissions**)
  - Attachments in Discord shows proper links in Minecraft
  - Support Minecraft templates based on Discord roles

## Getting Started for server owners and players

[GETTING STARTED.md](GETTING STARTED.md)

## Migrating from 1.x.x or 2.0.0

[MIGRATE.md](MIGRATE.md)

## Build your own .jar

1. Clone this repository
1. Run `gradlew`
1. The jar file will be in `build/libs/DiscordBridge-{version}-all.jar`.

## Commands

- `/discord login`: login to Discord and bind the Discord account to the Minecraft account for automatic login in the future. The email and password will not be stored; instead, the access token of the user will be stored in the config folder on the server.
- `/discord otp`: One-time password for Discord login _(thanks Prototik)_.
- `/discord logout`: logout of Discord and unbind the Discord account from the Minecraft account. 
- `/discord broadcast`: as this plugin cannot capture server's `/say` at the moment, this command is to send a message to all online players and Discord. This command requires having the default account set up.
- `/discord status`: show current connection status.
- `/discord reload`: reload configurations.
- `/discord reconnect`: reconnect Discord connection.

A short summary is below:

| Command | Shorthand | Permission |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| `/discord login` | `/d l` | `discordbridge.login` |
| `/discord otp` | `/d otp` | `discordbridge.login` |
| `/discord logout` | `/d lo` | `discordbridge.login` |
| `/discord broadcast <message>` | `/d b <message>` | `discordbridge.broadcast` |
| `/discord status` | `/d s` | `discordbridge.status` |
| `/discord reload` | `/d reload` | `discordbridge.reload` |
| `/discord reconnect` | `/d reconnect` | `discordbridge.reconnect` |
