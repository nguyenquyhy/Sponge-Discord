# Discord Bridge
This is a [Sponge](http://spongepowered.com) plugin to integrate [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) server with a [Discord](https://discordapp.com) channel. 

## Features

- Player's chat messages in Minecraft are sent to specified Discord channels, and chat messages in specific Discord channels are also sent to online players in Minecraft.
- Admins and mods can log in to their own Discord account, so that chat messages show under their names in Discord.
- Emoji is converted between Minecraft and Discord format. Details are showed in [EMOJI.md](EMOJI.md).
- Clickable URL.
- **New in 2.0.0** Multiple channels with custom configuration for each channel. E.g.:
  - 1 public channel to send & receive messages between Discord and Minecraft
  - 1 monitoring channel to record only server start/stop and player join/leave events
  - 1 staff-only channel that send message one-way from Discord to Minecraft with a special announcement template
- **New in 2.2.0**
  - Set game activity of the bot
  - Ignore Discord messages from all bots and/or blacklist certain prefixes
  - Support One-Time Password

## Getting Started for server owners and players

[GETTING STARTED.md](GETTING STARTED.md)

## Migrating from version 1.x.x
- `/discord default` command and default account are no longer available. You must setup a Discord Bot for the plugin to properly function.
- Your current configuration will be migrated automatically from `config.conf` into `config.json`.
- Invite code has been removed. Please contact me if you have specific need for that.
- Default anonymouss chat template is changed to ```"`%a:\` %s"```, which looks nicer in my opinion.

## Build your own .jar

1. Clone this repository
1. Run `gradlew`
1. The jar file will be in `build/libs/DiscordBridge-{version}-all.jar`.

## Commands

- `/discord login`: login to Discord and bind the Discord account to the Minecraft account for automatic login in the future. The email and password will not be stored; instead, the access token of the user will be stored in the config folder on the server.
- `/discord otp`: One-time password for Discord login _(thanks Prototik)_.
- `/discord logout`: logout of Discord and unbind the Discord account from the Minecraft account. 
- `/discord broadcast`: as this plugin cannot capture server's `/say` at the moment, this command is to send a message to all online players and Discord. This command requires having the default account set up.
- `/discord status`: show current connection status.
- `/discord reload`: reload configurations.

A short summary is below:

| Command | Shorthand | Permission |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| `/discord login` | `/d l` | `discordbridge.login` |
| `/discord otp` | `/d otp` | `discordbridge.login` |
| `/discord logout` | `/d lo` | `discordbridge.login` |
| `/discord broadcast <message>` | `/d b <message>` | `discordbridge.broadcast` |
| `/discord status` | `/d s` | `discordbridge.status` |
| `/discord reload` | `/d reload` | `discordbridge.reload` |

Some ideas for future commands

| Command | Note |
|---------|------|
| `/discord config` | Show current configuration |
| `/discord status` | Show current Discord account |
